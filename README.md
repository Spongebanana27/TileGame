# TileGame

A game based roughly on my tilePercolation project, as well as other similar games I have played in the past

The game consists of a gameboard covered in multicolored tiles. The player can change the color of a tile, and all those part of that color 'chunk'. The goal of the game is to have a game board that is a uniform color.
